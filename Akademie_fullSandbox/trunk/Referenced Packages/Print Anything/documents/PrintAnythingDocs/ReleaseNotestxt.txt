v1.0 : Initial Release 09/19/06

-------------------------------------

v1.1 : Bug fixes & One New Feature 10/27/06


Bugs

B010000 : Entity Sequence Numbering not consistent
	  When queries returned zero rows, subsequent queries from the same entity had different numbers appended 
	  compared with when results were present. Now all queries have the sequence number appended.

B010002 : multi-record queries with no results terminate processing
	  When a query is defined to return multiple records and zero exist, processing stops.


B010004 : date formatting on null dates terminates processing
	  When using {DATE:entity.field} syntax, the template never renders if a value is not present.	  


Features

B010006 : support templates >32k using documents
	  It is now possible to use a document for the template source instead of the long text field. This allows
	  any size of template i.e. > 32k which is the long text field limit.

Upgrade Steps

Bug# B010000 changes the behaviour of the driver so that the merge fields all have the query sequence appended to
the entity name. This means that any queries that reference these values need to be changed. Also templates need to
be updated. If you run your package in debug mode, you can see the changes easily.
